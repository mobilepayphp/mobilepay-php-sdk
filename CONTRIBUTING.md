# Contributing guidelines

Contributing to MobilePay PHP SDK should be as enjoyable as possible.
There are only a few requirements:

## Code-style related requirements

* tests live along-side tested code
* code is formatted according to .php-cs-fixer configuration

## Organisational requirements

* creating an issue first is needed for breaking changes and other big changes
* please explain why a change is needed and how it solves the problem
